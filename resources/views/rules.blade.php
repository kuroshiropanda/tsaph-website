<p style="font-size: 32px;"><strong>Welcome to Twitch Sana All PH! #ShowUp!</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">TSAPH was created to help strengthen the Filipino streaming community, rather than diminish.
    Our community is comprised of viewers, moderators, supporters, technical people, artists, streamers and regulars
    with tons of shared experiences, working together to foster a positive community.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">We massively support each other, help evolve each other’s personal brands, and on the
    weekends, grab a drink. At the core, TSAPH membership is obtained through your own personal investment to the goals
    of the Twitch Sana All PH community.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Why was TSAPH formed?</p>
<p style=" font-size: 20px;">We’re on Twitch and it’s awesome—so we want to get the word out to more people. The idea of
    building a community started when we found ourselves too scattered, but once we got to know more about each other,
    we realized that we all shared the same goal: We want to increase awareness and Twitch viewership in the
    Philippines.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">So how do we do that?</p>
<p style=" font-size: 20px;">Glad you hypothetically asked. Think of us as your Twitch barkada. And one of our
    friendship goals is to build a mighty team that drives more people to watch content created by Filipino Twitch
    streamers. Got something in mind? Don’t be shy to start a conversation, because fresh ideas play an important role
    to achieve our goals.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">If you look at the bigger picture, we can achieve this goal by attending social events, using social media, and using our own personal influence to promote TSAPH.</p>

<p style=" font-size: 20px;">One more thing… TSAPH is NOT a stream team. We do not want you to feel forced watching (or
    lurking), following, or subscribing, or even raiding anyone from the team. We DO NOT follow this conventional setup,
    and know very well that this does not align with the goals we’re trying to achieve. You support a streamer because
    you want to support him/her NOT because we told you to. Remember: We help build the community by genuinely helping
    others.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to anyone from the community. We’re friendly (really!).</p>
